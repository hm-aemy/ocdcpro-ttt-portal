Held once per year, it aims to foster collaboration and education in analog and digital design using the GF180MCU open-source PDK. The contest encourages participation from pre-college students, undergraduates, and underrepresented regions, with teams mentored by experienced IC designers. This year\u2019s focus includes MOSbius-style chips, LLM-driven digital workflows, and AI-assisted analog layout automation using gLayout, promoting hands-on learning and community-driven innovation.",
